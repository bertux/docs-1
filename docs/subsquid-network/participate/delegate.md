# Delegate

The easiest way to participate in Subsquid Network is to delegate your `SQD` tokens to one of the workers. Here's how to do it.

1. Go to [network.subsquid.io](https://network.subsquid.io).

2. Go to the "Dashboard" tab if you aren't there already. You should see something like this:

   ![Network app dashboard](./delegate_dashboard.png)

3. Pick a worker and press the "Delegate" button. You should see a form like this:

   ![Delegation form](./delegate_form.png)

   Enter the amount of `SQD`s you'd like to delegate and press the button.
